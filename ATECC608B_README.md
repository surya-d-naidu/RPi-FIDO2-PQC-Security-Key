# ATECC608B Secure Element Integration

This document describes the integration of the ATECC608B secure cryptographic element with the FIDO2 PQC Security Key.

## Overview

The ATECC608B is a cryptographic co-processor that provides:
- Hardware-based key generation and storage
- Secure cryptographic operations
- Hardware random number generation
- Tamper-resistant key storage

## Hardware Setup

### Wiring (I2C)
Connect the ATECC608B to your Raspberry Pi:
- VCC → 3.3V
- GND → Ground
- SDA → GPIO 2 (Pin 3)
- SCL → GPIO 3 (Pin 5)

### I2C Address
Default I2C address: `0x60`

## Software Setup

1. Run the setup script:
```bash
chmod +x setup_atecc608b.sh
./setup_atecc608b.sh
```

2. Reboot the system:
```bash
sudo reboot
```

3. Test the connection:
```bash
i2cdetect -y 1
python3 test_atecc608b.py
```

## Integration Features

### Secure Key Storage
- **Slots 0-7**: ECC P-256 private keys for FIDO2 credentials
- **Slots 8-15**: Data storage for credential metadata, RP hashes, counters

### Hardware-Enhanced Security
1. **Key Generation**: Uses ATECC608B's true random number generator
2. **Signing**: Cryptographic operations performed in secure element
3. **Counter Management**: Hardware-based signature counters
4. **AAGUID**: Hardware-derived authenticator GUID

### Slot Allocation
```
Key Slots (0-7):
- Slot 0: Device identity key
- Slot 1: Attestation key
- Slots 2-7: User credential keys

Data Slots (8-15):
- Slot 8: Credential metadata
- Slot 9: User data
- Slot 10: Fingerprint template hash
- Slot 11: Device configuration/AAGUID
- Slot 12: RP signature counters
- Slot 13: Backup data
- Slot 14: Temporary storage
- Slot 15: System data
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Hardware Root of Trust**: Private keys never leave the secure element
2. **Tamper Resistance**: Physical attacks are detected and keys are wiped
3. **True Random**: Hardware-based entropy for all cryptographic operations
4. **Secure Storage**: Credential metadata protected in hardware
5. **Anti-Cloning**: Unique device identity tied to hardware serial

## API Functions

### SecureKeyStorage Class

#### Initialization
```python
storage = get_secure_storage_instance()
```

#### Key Management
```python
# Generate device key
public_key = storage.generate_device_key(slot)

# Sign with hardware key
signature = storage.sign_with_device_key(slot, data)
```

#### Data Storage
```python
# Store credential ID
storage.store_credential_id(slot, cred_id)

# Store RP hash
storage.store_rp_hash(slot, rp_id)

# Increment signature counter
count = storage.increment_sign_counter(rp_id)
```

#### Security Functions
```python
# Secure delete
storage.secure_delete_slot(slot)

# Health check
is_healthy = storage.health_check()

# Get hardware random
random_data = storage.get_hardware_random()
```

## Fallback Behavior

If ATECC608B is not available:
- System falls back to software-based cryptography
- Keys stored in encrypted file system
- Warning message displayed during initialization

## Troubleshooting

### I2C Issues
```bash
# Check I2C is enabled
sudo raspi-config

# Scan for devices
i2cdetect -y 1

# Check permissions
ls -l /dev/i2c-1
```

### Connection Problems
1. Verify wiring connections
2. Check power supply (3.3V)
3. Ensure I2C is enabled in raspi-config
4. Test with `test_atecc608b.py`

### Permission Errors
```bash
# Add user to i2c group
sudo usermod -a -G i2c $USER
# Logout and login again
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Physical Security**: Secure the device physically to prevent tampering
2. **Backup**: Hardware keys cannot be backed up - document recovery procedures
3. **Slot Management**: Carefully manage slot allocation to avoid conflicts
4. **Reset**: Hardware reset will permanently delete all keys

## Performance

- Key generation: ~200ms
- Signing operation: ~50ms
- Random generation: ~20ms
- I2C communication overhead: ~5ms per operation

## Limitations

1. **ECC P-256 Only**: ATECC608B only supports NIST P-256 curve
2. **Limited Slots**: Only 8 key slots and 8 data slots available
3. **No Backup**: Private keys cannot be extracted or backed up
4. **I2C Speed**: Limited by I2C bus speed (100kHz standard)

## Recovery Procedures

### Lost Keys
Hardware-stored keys cannot be recovered. Implement proper key lifecycle management.

### Device Failure
1. Replace ATECC608B
2. Re-register all credentials
3. Update device identity

### Slot Corruption
Use `secure_delete_slot()` to clear corrupted slots and regenerate keys.
